Welcome to Sytac! This guide will describe some topics that you can/should read up on after joining the company. Every developer has a different background and everyone knows more or less about different topics depending on their experience. The aim of this guide will be to create a baseline in terms of Frontend knowledge. The content of this guide is based on both the projects at our clients as well as their intake procedures. Going through this guide will provide you a solid foundation of knowledge to be able to go on intakes and hit the ground running at our clients.
